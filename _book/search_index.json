bootcamps:\n\nhttps://github.com/lewagon/teaching\nhttps://github.com/lewagon/\nhttps://github.com/lewagon/html-css-challenges\nhttps://github.com/RebootAcademy/developer-roadmap\nhttps://github.com/ironhack/learn-js\n\n"},"teachers/":{"url":"teachers/","title":"Teachers","keywords":"","body":"Teachers\nHere

better. That way you can share with them keyboard shortcuts. We use VS Code\nWhen you are video-projecting your screen, please follow these guidelines:\n\nThe only app running on your computer should be Finder, Vs Code, Terminal and Browser\nHave your text editor and terminal with a light background. You can install the Solarized theme, with the VS Code package and the OSX terminal theme\nZoom a lot your font size (⌘=) in Vs Code and your terminal.\nIf you don't have a lot of files, hide the folder drawer on the left with ⌘K, ⌘B.\nSwitch from one file to the other with the ⌘P (Command Palette)\nYou should use two windows layouts:\nVs Code in full screen\nVertical split (50/50) with Vs Code on the right, Terminal on the left\n\n\n\n\nTools\nGist\nAfter a long session of live-coding, usually students ask for the code. They like to keep it on their computer, for future's reference. A quick way to share some code files is to use Github's gist service. A quicker way than copy/pasting manually every file is to install the gist gem on your computer:\n$ npm i -g gist-cli\n\nThen, in an exercise folder, you can run:\n$ gist -p *.js\n\nThis will automatically create a private gist with all the JavaScript files in the current folder. The program will give you the gist private URL that you can then share on Slack.\n"},"teachers/teacher_assistant.html":{"url":"teachers/teacher_assistant.html","title":"Teacher Assistant","keywords":"","body":"TA - Imbue\nHere is a list of guidelines you should follow during your day as Teaching Assistant.\nRules of the TA Club\nDuring your duty, keep in mind these simple rules:\n\nRule #1: Be prepared. Do again all the exercises the day before.\nRule #2: Have a lot of patience.\nRule #3: Repeat again, again and again.\nRule #4: Always be nice.\nRule #5: DO NOT take the keyboard (especially on the first 2 weeks).\nRule #6: DO NOT give the solution. First give hints, ask questions, debug with them. Then finally show and explain the solution if nothing else worked.\nRule #7: Pay attention to coding style. It's important they adopt a correct styling within the first weeks.\n\nIt's okay to say I don't know\nYES, it's okay to say that you don't know everything and that:\n\nYou're alumni of one of the previous batches ;\nYou're here to help them but sometimes you may not be able to answer to all their questions ;\nTeachers are here for these kind of tricky questions ;\nYou're here because YOU really understand their pain since you've been through the same issues ;\nYou'll be the ONE that will explain more easily tricky concepts because you'll use your own words.\n\nDon't underestimate your value in this bootcamp :)\nLive-code\nIf you need to drive a live-code, refer to the teaching display guide\n"},"setup/ubuntu.html":{"url":"setup/ubuntu.html","title":"Ubuntu","keywords":"","body":"Setup instructions\nThe following instructions will help you to get ready for Imbue fullstack bootcamp:\n\nGrab a text editor, ideally VSCode\nInstall a package manager\nPimp your Terminal\nSetup git and GitHub\nInstall Node\n\nGitHub account\nHave you signed up to GitHub? If not, do it right away.\n:point_right: Upload a picture and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is important as we'll use an internal dashboard with your avatars. Please do it now.\nGit\nTo install git, first open a terminal. To open a terminal, you can click on the Ubuntu Start button in the sidebar and type Terminal. Then click on the terminal icon.\nThen copy this line with Ctrl + C:\nsudo apt install -y git\n\n:bulb: To paste it in the terminal, you need to use Ctrl + Shift + V.\nVS Code - Your text editor\nA text editor is one of the most important tools of a developer.\nThe easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions is to download and install the .deb package (64-bit), either through the graphical software center if it's available, or through the command line with:\nsudo apt install ./.deb\n\nTo download the file you can go to the VS Code downloads page\n:point_up: This command will ask for your password with: [sudo] password for :. Don't panick! Calmy type your password key by key. You won't have a visual feedback (like little *), that's perfectly normal, keep on typing. When you're done, hit Enter :muscle:.\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install code # or code-insiders\n\nOh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal\nWe will use the shell named zsh instead of bash, the default one.\nsudo apt install -y zsh curl vim nodejs imagemagick jq\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)\"\n# it will ask for your session password\n\nBe careful, those commands will ask you to type your password twice. At the end\nyour prompt should look like this:\n\nIf it doesn't, ask a teacher.\nTo make this change stick, restart your laptop (or virtual machine):\nsudo reboot\n\nGitHub\nWe need to generate SSH keys which are going to be used by GitHub and Heroku\nto authenticate you. Think of it as a way to log in, but different from the\nwell known username/password couple. If you already generated keys\nthat you already use with other services, you can skip this step.\nOpen a terminal and type this, replacing the email with yours (the\nsame one you used to create your GitHub account). It will prompt\nfor information. Just press enter until it asks for a passphrase.\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C \"TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com\"\n\nNB: when asked for a passphrase, put something you want (and that you'll remember),\nit's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. You'll type,\nnothing will show up on the screen, that's normal. Just type the passphrase,\nand when you're done, press Enter.\nThen you need to give your public key to GitHub. Run:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n\nIt will prompt on the screen the content of the id_ed25519.pub file. Copy that text,\nthen go to github.com/settings/ssh. Click on\nAdd SSH key, fill in the Title with your computer name, and paste the Key.\nFinish by clicking on the Add key green button.\nTo check that this step is completed, in the terminal run this. You will be\nprompted a warning, type yes then Enter.\nssh -T git@github.com\n\nIf you see something like this, you're done!\n# Hi --------! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access\n\nIf it does not work, try running this before trying again the ssh -T command:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\nDon't be in a rush, take time to read this article to get a better\nunderstanding of what those keys are used for.\nInstalling Node\nNode.js package is available in the LTS release and the current release. It’s your choice to select which version you want to install on the system as per your requirements. Let’s add the PPA to your system to install Nodejs on Ubuntu.\nUse Current Release: At te last update of this tutorial, Node.js 13 is the current Node.js release available.\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -\n\nYou can successfully add Node.js PPA to the Ubuntu system. Now execute the below command install Node on and Ubuntu using apt-get. This will also install NPM with node.js. This command also installs many other dependent packages on your system.\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nAfter installing node.js verify and check the installed version. You can find more details about current version on node.js official website.\nnode -v \n`\n\nv13.3.0\nInstalling Docker\nIf you have any problem, please refer to the docker ubuntu installation page\nFirst we are going to clear up the old versions\nsudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\n\nUpdate the apt package index.\n sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the latest version of Docker Engine - Community and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:\nTo install a specific version of Docker Engine - Community, list the available versions in the repo, then select and install:\na. List the versions available in your repo:\n apt-cache madison docker-ce\n\nb. Install a specific version using the version string from the second column, for example, 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial.\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce= docker-ce-cli= containerd.io\n\nVerify that Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.\nsudo docker run hello-world\n\nMongo Docker Image\nIn a few weeks, we'll talk about SQL and Databases and you'll need something called MongoDB,\nan open-source robust and production-ready database. Let's download it now.\nThe simplest solution to download our image is to execute the following:\ndocker pull mongo\n\nWith the image available to us, we need to deploy it. In its simplest form, and what is outlined in the Docker Hub documentation, we can execute the following command:\ndocker run --name mongodb mongo:4.0.4\nThis command works, but there are potentially a few problems. What we’re doing is we are running a container and naming it mongodb. We aren’t running it in the background and if we wanted to connect to it, we’d have to do it from another container instance. In other words, we wouldn’t be able to connect to it from our host computer or server.\nInstead, what we could do is the following:\ndocker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongodb mongo:4.0.4\n\nUbuntu inotify\nUbuntu is always tracking changes in your folders, and to do this it uses inotify.\nBy default the Ubuntu limit is set to 8192 files monitored.\nAs programming involves a lot of files, we need to raise this limit.\nIn your terminal run:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p\n\nSlack\nInstall Slack for Linux (beta).\nLaunch the app and sign in to imbue-program organization.\nMake sure you upload a picture there.\nYou can also sign in to Slack on your iPhone or Android device!\nThe idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.\nEnjoy your ride with Imbue :)\n"},"setup/macOs.html":{"url":"setup/macOs.html","title":"macOs","keywords":"","body":"https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macOS.md\n"},"setup/windows.html":{"url":"setup/windows.html","title":"windows","keywords":"","body":"https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/WINDOWS.md\n"},"awesome_resources/":{"url":"awesome_resources/","title":"Awesome Resources","keywords":"","body":"Awesome Resources\nDevelopers around the world collaborate to create amazing open-source lists where they gather different sources of knowledge.\nWe found some of them and linked them here for you:\n\nAwesome JavaScript\nAwesome a curated list of almost everything.\nAwesome Node\n\n\nAwesome CSS\nFree Software Books\nAwesome Awesomeness\nList of lists\nAwesome free resources for your startup\nThe book of secret knowledge\nWebsites a programmer should visit\nMicrosoft REST API guideliness\n\n"},"interviews/":{"url":"interviews/","title":"Interview Resources","keywords":"","body":"Interviews\nHere there are some useful resources about the interview process: \n\nInterview Cheatsheet\nTech Interview Handbook\nFront End Interview Handbook\nCoding Interview University\n\n"},"interviews/cheatsheet.html":{"url":"interviews/cheatsheet.html","title":"Interview Cheatsheet","keywords":"","body":"Interview Cheatsheet\nThis is a straight-to-the-point, distilled list of technical interview Do's and Don'ts, mainly for algorithmic interviews. Some of these may apply to only phone screens or whiteboard interviews, but most will apply to both. I revise this list before each of my interviews to remind myself of them and eventually internalized all of them to the point I do not have to rely on it anymore.\nLegend\n\n✅ = Do\n❌ = Don't\n⚠️ = Situational\n\nBefore interview\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nPrepare pen, paper and earphones/headphones.\n\n\n✅\nFind a quiet environment with good Internet connection.\n\n\n✅\nEnsure webcam and audio are working. There were times I had to restart Chrome to get Hangouts to work again.\n\n\n✅\nRequest for the option to interview over Hangouts/Skype instead of a phone call; it is easier to send links or text across.\n\n\n✅\nDecide on and be familiar with a programming language.\n\n\n✅\nFamiliarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc.\n\n\n✅\nPrepare answers to the frequently-asked behavioral questions in an interview.\n\n\n✅\nPrepare some questions to ask at the end of the interview.\n\n\n✅\nDress comfortably. Usually you do not need to wear smart clothes, casual should be fine. T-shirts and jeans are acceptable at most places.\n\n\n✅\nStay calm and composed.\n\n\n⚠️\nTurn off the webcam if possible. Most remote interviews will not require video chat and leaving it on only serves as a distraction.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nIntroduce yourself in a few sentences under a minute or two.\n\n\n✅\nMention interesting points that are relevant to the role you are applying for.\n\n\n✅\nSound enthusiastic! Speak with a smile and you will naturally sound more engaging.\n\n\n❌\nSpend too long introducing yourself. The more time you spend talking the less time you have to code.\n\n\n\nUpon receiving the question\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nRepeat the question back at the interviewer.\n\n\n✅\nClarify any assumptions you made subconsciously. Many questions are under-specified on purpose. E.g. a tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work.\n\n\n✅\nClarify input format and range. Ask whether input can be assumed to be well-formed and non-null.\n\n\n✅\nWork through a small example to ensure you understood the question.\n\n\n✅\nExplain a high level approach even if it is a brute force one.\n\n\n✅\nImprove upon the approach and optimize. Reduce duplicated work and cache repeated computations.\n\n\n✅\nThink carefully, then state and explain the time and space complexity of your approaches.\n\n\n✅\nIf stuck, think about related problems you have seen before and how they were solved. Check out the tips in this section.\n\n\n❌\nIgnore information given to you. Every piece is important.\n\n\n❌\nJump into coding straightaway.\n\n\n❌\nStart coding without interviewer's green light.\n\n\n❌\nAppear too unsure about your approach or analysis.\n\n\n\nDuring coding\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nExplain what you are coding/typing to the interviewer, what you are trying to achieve.\n\n\n✅\nPractice good coding style. Clear variable names, consistent operator spacing, proper indentation, etc.\n\n\n✅\nType/write at a reasonable speed.\n\n\n✅\nAs much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode.\n\n\n✅\nWrite in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions.\n\n\n✅\nAsk for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time.\n\n\n✅\nUse the hints given by the interviewer.\n\n\n✅\nDemonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language.\n\n\n✅\nDemonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms.\n\n\n✅\nIf you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., \"Under non-interview settings, I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using split() which may not cover all cases.\"\n\n\n✅\nPractice whiteboard space-management skills.\n\n\n⚠️\nReasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer.\n\n\n❌\nRemain quiet the whole time.\n\n\n❌\nSpend too much time writing comments.\n\n\n❌\nUse extremely verbose or single-character (unless they're common like i, n) variable names.\n\n\n❌\nCopy and paste code without checking (e.g. variables need to be renamed).\n\n\n❌\nInterrupt your interviewer when they are talking. Usually if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction.\n\n\n❌\nWrite too big (takes up too much space) or too small (illegible) if on a whiteboard.\n\n\n\nAfter coding\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nScan through your code for mistakes as if it was your first time seeing code written by someone else.\n\n\n✅\nCheck for off-by-one errors.\n\n\n✅\nCome up with more test cases. Try extreme test cases.\n\n\n✅\nStep through your code with those test cases.\n\n\n✅\nLook out for places where you can refactor.\n\n\n✅\nReiterate the time and space complexity of your code.\n\n\n✅\nExplain trade-offs and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time.\n\n\n❌\nImmediately announce that you are done coding. Do the above first!\n\n\n❌\nArgue with the interviewer. They may be wrong but that is very unlikely given that they are familiar with the question.\n\n\n\nWrap up\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nAsk questions. More importantly, ask good and engaging questions that are tailored to the company! Pick some questions from this list.\n\n\n✅\nThank the interviewer.\n\n\n⚠️\nAsk about your interview performance. It can get awkward.\n\n\n❌\nEnd the interview without asking any questions.\n\n\n\nPost interview\n\n\n\n\nThings\n\n\n\n\n✅\nRecord the interview questions and answers down as these can be useful for future reference.\n\n\n⚠️\nSend a follow up email to your interviewer(s) thanking them for their time and the opportunity to interview with them.\n\n\n\n"},"program/":{"url":"program/","title":"Full Stack Developer","keywords":"","body":"Welcome to the Full Stack Web Developer Program\nThis program is structurated in 9 weeks of lessons.
