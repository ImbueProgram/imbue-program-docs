<p>This is a straight-to-the-point, distilled list of technical interview Do&apos;s and Don&apos;ts, mainly for algorithmic interviews. Some of these may apply to only phone screens or whiteboard interviews, but most will apply to both. I revise this list before each of my interviews to remind myself of them and eventually internalized all of them to the point I do not have to rely on it anymore.</p>
