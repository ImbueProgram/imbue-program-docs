## Pull Requests
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

In a project, teams use pull requests to review their code before merging it into a branch. This allows to teams to improve their code quality and give feedback. In some companies code is not merged after a tough pull-request review is done.
