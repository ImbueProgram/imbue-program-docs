# Getting Started In Software

First things first! 

This page holds information about basic things you need to know in order to be a software developer.

Software developers in their day-to-day work need to use some tools. These tools include: CLI (command line), git, GitHub (or alternatives) and a text editor. Depending on your tech stack you will also need to learn about CI/CD systems, compilers and more.

## Software

## Bash
Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.

If you want to know what commands you can use, take a look to [the bash cheatsheet](program/software/cheatsheets/bash.md)

You can take this nodeschool tutorial to complete your knowledge.

Open a **terminal** and type `npm install -g learnyoubash`, press enter, and later type `learnyoubash`. You will need to have [node](program/backend/node.md) installed.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
> A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS.

# Git 

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Getting started with Github

> GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project
