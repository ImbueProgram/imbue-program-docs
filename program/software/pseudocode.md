# Pseudocode

Pseudo-code is an informal way to express the design of a computer program or an algorithm. Many programmers use it to plan out the function of an algorithm before setting themselves to the more technical task of coding.

- Describing how an algorithm should work. Pseudocode can illustrate where a particular construct, mechanism, or technique could or must appear in a program.
- Explaining a computing process to less-technical users. Computers need a very strict input syntax to run a program, but humans (especially non-programmers) may find it easier to understand a more fluid, subjective language that clearly states the purpose of each line of code.
- Designing code in a group setting. High-level software architects will often include pseudocode into their designs to help solve a complex problem they see their programmers running into. If you are developing a program along with other coders, you may find that pseudocode helps make your intentions clear.

 
## How to write a Pseudo-code?

1 - Arrange the sequence of tasks and write the pseudocode accordingly.
2 - Start with the statement of a pseudo code which establishes the main goal or the aim.
Example:
```
This program will allow the user to check
the number whether it's even or odd.
```

3 - The way the if-else, for, while loops are indented in a program, indent the statements likewise, as it helps to comprehend the decision control and execution mechanism. They also improve the readability to a great extent.
Example:

```
if "1"
    print response
        "I am case 1"

if "2"
    print response
        "I am case 2"
```

4 - Use appropriate naming conventions. The human tendency follows the approach to follow what we see. If a programmer goes through a pseudo code, his approach will be the same as per it, so the naming must be simple and distinct.

5 - Use appropriate sentence casings, such as CamelCase for methods, upper case for constants and lower case for variables.

6 - Elaborate everything which is going to happen in the actual code. Don’t make the pseudo code abstract.

7 - Use standard programming structures such as ‘if-then’, ‘for’, ‘while’, ‘cases’ the way we use it in programming.

8 - Check whether all the sections of a pseudo code is complete, finite and clear to understand and comprehend.

9 - Don’t write the pseudo code in a complete programmatic manner. It is necessary to be simple to understand even for a layman or client, hence don’t incorporate too many technical terms. 

## Examples

```javascript
if clientExist
  buyItem()
  performOperation()
else
  waitUntilSomething()
```

```
Set total to zero

Set grade counter to one

While grade counter is less than or equal to ten

Input the next grade
Add the grade into the total
Set the class average to the total divided by ten

Print the class average.
```
