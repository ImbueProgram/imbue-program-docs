# Imbue Program

Welcome to the Imbue Program

There are a few things you should have right know:
- A mentor that will help you go trhough your choosen paths, each program has different mentors, so if you choose to start a new program let the school know about it.
- A learning path. When you registered in the school we created a learning path for you, depending on your level and your destination. When you follow the program you will level up on your path and win more points.
- A **student identification number** this ID is personal and unique, it is composed by the school you registered in (for example: `MAD`) and a number (001).
This identification number will be the name of your exercises repository.

## How to use this material?

You will need to have patience and learn how to self-learn. Here you will find relevant information to develop all of your knowledge, and the mentors will assist you whenever you are stuck with something. 

For example: If you choose the [Javascript path](program/frontend/README.md), you will need to navigate through it's contents and learn each of the subjects.
The subjects include theory, external references and video tutorials. 
You can choose the order and the speed of your learning, but you must submit your exercises to level up.


## Point System

Each time you complete a subject, help another student, participate in some event (hackathons, masterclasses, etc) you will receive a set of points. Each school has a ranking system where students compete weekly, monthly and yearly within this point system. Points serve as a visual representation of your engagement in the school's community. It also serves as a metric to measure your progress, along with your level.

## Levels

Each student has a level from 0 to 6. Every level has a different approach to education and you will be taught in a different manner. 
- Levels 0-2: The mentor will guide the students on those levels more closely, helping them to decide a correct path and approach. 
- Levels 3-4: People on the level 3 and 4 start reviewing other's people work, this way they contribute back to the community and spread their knowledge.
- Levels 5-6: People on levels 5 and 6 have a more practical approach to education, having the basic knowledge they are ready to work on MVPs, project ideas, try new technologies, create educational content, organize hackathons and events.
- Level 7: Level 7 is reserved to the mentors. Any level 6 student can request to be a mentor in the school. To mantain a level 7, the mentor is responsible of dynamizing the school, mentoring other students, organizing events and making the community grow. Mentors don't pay membership fee and instead they receive a salary from the school. 

Other exits: At level 7 you can choose to remain a mentor or enter as a School Developer. School developers work in projects for external companies. Thoose projects are found by the school and supervised by members of it.


## How to level up?
In each section you will find some tutorials that will guide you through the different subjects and also some exercises.  Your mentor will guide you through your education process and once you are ready you can try to perform the assignments. You will need to complete the assignments in each training section in order to level up. 
Points do not make you level up, only your knowledge. But once you are on a level you compete with all the other students in that level, that's where points come in hand.

## How to submit my assignments? 

At the beggining of your course the school will have a repository where you will code all your exercises. You will need to fork it and every time you want a mentor to check one of your exercises you will need to create a new pull request from your fork of the repository to the school's one.
