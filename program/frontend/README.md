# Full Stack Javascript

Welcome to the JavaScript path. One of the most demanded languages in web development. With JavaScript you will be able to:
- Build awesome [websites](https://reactjs.org/)
- Create [videogames](https://phaser.io/)
- [Mobile](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) applications
- Control [robotics](https://nodebots.io/) 
- Digital [art](https://p5js.org/)

If you want general knowledge about programming, Git, Github refer to the [software path](/program/software/README.md).

## Getting started:

To start coding you need the following:
- Basic understanding of what a [CLI]((https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp)) is and how it works
- Basic tooling like: A [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), node, a web browser
- [Git](http://github.com/) is a MUST to start coding with good practices

If you don't meet those requirements, continue with the getting started page, else, go directly to the [setup](program/frontend/setup/README.md) page and install whatever you are missing.

The first things you will need to do are:
- Create a [Github account](https://github.io) and refer to the [getting started](program/software/getting_started.md) guide.
  - In this guide you will learn some **bash** and **git** concepts, which are essentials to software developers.
- Once you have completed your [setup](program/frontend/setup/README.md), go to the *Subjects* section in this page, and start by the first levels. 
  - The setup is needed for installing tools like `node`, `git` and `vscode`. 
- Start by learning HTML and CSS. 
  - Later move to JS.
- After you learned some basic things you are ready to try doing our [exercises](program/frontend/exercises/README.md)
