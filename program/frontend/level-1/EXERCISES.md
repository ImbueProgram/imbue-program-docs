Now [clone](program/software/git.md) the repository and start your exercises. First, create a `README.md` file with a description about what course are you doing and why. 

Add a little info about yourself:

```
This is the repository for the Imbue Program, I am doing this course to learn about HTML, CSS, JS.
```

Take a look at the [example repo](https://github.com/imbue-program/MAD-001-exercises).

Once you push the code it will be available for your mentor to review. Please notify your mentor once you completed the assignments.

The rest of the exercises will go inside different folders `exercise-1` , `exercise-2` and so on.



# Exercise 1 - TDD 

If you don't know about TDD, please refer to [TDD](program/software/tdd.md)

In this exercise you are going to program a Rocket using TDD. 

If you look into the folder of the [example repo]() you will see the following structure:

```
- src
  - Rocket.js
- specs
  - RocketSpec.js
- specRunner.html
```

When you open `specRunner.html` in your browser it will run the Rocket tests. Some of them will fail. Your goal is to fix all this tests and submit your solution.
