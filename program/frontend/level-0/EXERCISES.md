The rest of the exercises will go inside different folders `exercise-1` , `exercise-2` and so on.

## 2 - A basic website 
Knowledge needed: [HTML, CSS]
Create a folder named `exercise-2` and inside of this folder you should create at least this basic structure:
```
-exercise1
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - main.js
```
The website needs to load the `styles.css` file and the `main.js` file. 

In the website you should include important elements like `h1`, `h2`, `p`, and basic page structure. 

For example, you can follow a structure like the following one: 

<img src="https://imbueprogram.github.io/imbue-program-docs/images/simple-web.jpg" />

### 2b - Responsive 
Add [media queries](program/frontend/css.md) to make it responsive. It should be visible in mobile and desktop.

## 3 - Javascript Exercises
Create a `exercise-3` folder in your repository, inside this repository create a javascript file for each exercise.

### String replacement

Create a function called `replaceString` that receives two arguments, one string and one replacement string. The values you need to replace are the `xxx`from the first string with the second string values. For example:

```javascript
const result = replaceString('abc-xxx-3424-xxx-akgp', 'MMM')

// result should be 'abc-MMM-3424-MMM-akgp'
```

### A pyramid!

Create a function in javascript that prints a pyramid like this one, each row represents a level of the pyramid.

```
#
##
###
####
```

The function should receive an argument representing the levels of the pyramid. For example `createPyramid(3)` will print a pyramid with 3 levels, `createPyramid(5)` will print a pyramid with 5 levels.

### Array Sorting
Create a function called `sortArray`, this function receives an array as an argument. Given an unordered array `[1,3,65,2,4,5,19,90]` this function returns an ordered array `[1,2,3,4,5,19,64,90]`.

For examle `sortArray([6,4,1,7])` returns `[1,4,6,7]`


### Array filling

Create a function called `fillArray` that receives a ordered array and fills the missing numbers.  
For example `fillArray([1, 4, 6])` returns `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. 

## 4 DOM Manipulation

Create a basic website with HTML and add a `main.js` javascript file . 
The website will have 3 squares, like the ones from Exercise 1. Once the user clicks on a square, it will be deleted from the website, leaving the other squares.


## 5 - A todo list 

Create a folder `exercise-5` in your assignment.
knowledge needed: [HTML, CSS, JS]

- Website: 
  - Displays a list of elements that represent a task list

<img src="https://imbueprogram.github.io/imbue-program-docs/images/todolist.png" />
