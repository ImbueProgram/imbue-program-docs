# HTML

To build websites, you should know about HTML â€” the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.

We encourage you to fully read [Learning Pathway MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Html) (or at least the introduction to HTML). MDN will be a source of documentation for you along your career.

Go to [html5 introduction](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/) and complete all the lessons. This is the first module in the "Responsive Web design Certification" of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

Once you are done, speak to your mentor and continue all the lessons until you finish the full certification. This is the first milestone to start filling your CV.
